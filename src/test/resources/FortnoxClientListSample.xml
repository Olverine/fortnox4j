    <!--
    	FortnoxApiClients are the integration API clients, meaning the agent that
    	accesses a specific Fortnox client in order to read/write data to Fortnox
    	clients.
    	An API client has an ID and a corresponding clientSecret. This secret is the
    	secret of the actual API integration. The secret is combined with the specific
    	accessToken of a specific Fortnox client to gain access to that Fortnox client.
    	
    	There can be many ApiClients with different purposes and access rights. This is
    	why it's a list.  
    	
    	Before proceeding the values in FortnoxApiClient must be set and you get the
    	values from your integration.
    	
    	NOTE!! You'll also need to set the clientId in the FortnoxClientInfo-structure,
    	search and replace "TestClientId" to your integration's clientId.

			These fields are not necessary since that information is obtainable

			However, currently, the organization number is used as a key to lookup
			clientInfo records, so currently it must be provided in this record.
